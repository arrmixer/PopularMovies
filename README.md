# PopularMovies 

This is the second project toward my Android Nano Degree at Udacity. I was excited because this is the first Android project I'm doing completely from scratch. In this stage the specifications were as followed:
● Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
● Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
○ The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
● Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
○ original title
○ movie poster image thumbnail
○ A plot synopsis (called overview in the api) ○ user rating (called vote_average in the api) ○ release date

I needed to use the MovieDB api to fetch the data. I also used Picasso to download the images. The rubric was straightforward and easy to follow. I decided to go a little overboard and wanted to implement a lot of the concepts I learned both in the Scholarship Challenge course and The Big Nerd Ranch Android Development Book. 

Though not required, I implemented Fragments, RecyclerView, DataBinding(MVVM), and Parcelable Interface.  To do this, I referenced both my Projects in the Challenge Course(Sunshine App) https://github.com/arrmixer/ud851-Sunshine
and The Big Nerd Ranch Android Development Book https://github.com/arrmixer/Android. In addition, I used the following resources to help build the project.
